***
Lavender is an interpreted, pure functional REPL-based programming language. It supports built in floating point numbers and strings, with vectors, lists, hashtables, and functional monads implemented in the standard libraries. Lavender is untyped, and it represents all values as functions.

This repository houses the Lavender documentation site, as well as the original Lavender interpreter implementation in Java. The Java implementation is no longer being maintained; Lavender is now implemented in C and can be found at [https://github.com/kvverti/clavender](https://github.com/kvverti/clavender).

Further documentation can be found on the [GitHub pages site](https://kvverti.github.io/lavender).
